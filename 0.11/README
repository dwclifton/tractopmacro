= !TopMacro =

TopMacro is exceedingly simple, like all good software ;-). In a nutshell, it
does exactly what you think it would, inserts a "top of page" link in your Wiki
page. The only option is a string that is inserted into the content of the markup.
This defaults to a single circumflex "!^" character (more commonly known as a caret),
surrounded by square brackets. The anchor element returned includes a "Top of Page"
title attribute so the user knows its purpose, and a "topofpage" class so the Wiki
author may style it in any way they please.

{{{
[[Top]] becomes:

[<span class="topofpage"><a href="#" title="Top of page">^</a></span>]
}}}

You could of course achieve the same effect by doing this:

{{{
{{{
#!html
[<a href="#" title="Top of page">^</a>]
}}}
}}}

Resulting in this:

{{{
#!html
[<a href="#" title="Top of page">^</a>]
}}}

But who wants to do all that typing?

That's what [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science) macros] are for
after all. Note that the brackets do not form part of the anchor itself. That is a
personal preference. If you pass a string to the macro they are ommited.

== Styling ==

If you like the caret, but prefer to omit the brackets and style the link yourself
with CSS, try this:

{{{
[[Top(^)]]
}}}

{{{
.topofpage {
  background-color: #eaeaea;
  color: #eff5f16;
  padding: 2px 4px 0;
  border: 1px solid #c6c7db;
}
}}}

Resulting in:

[[Top(^)]]

Note that if you're going to style the anchor like this you should really pass an
argument to the macro or you'll end up with the default brackets in addition to
the styling.

== Installation ==

{{{
python setup.py bdist_egg
cp dist/*.egg /trac/env/Project/plugins
}}}

== Configuration ==

Enable the macro in:

/trac/env/Project/conf/trac.ini:

{{{
[components]
top.* = enabled
}}}

You may need to restart your Web server.

== Examples ==

{{{
[[Top]]
[[Top(^)]]
[[Top(top)]]
[[Top(Top of page)]]
}}}
