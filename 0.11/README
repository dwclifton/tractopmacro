= !TopMacro =

TopMacro is exceedingly simple, like all good software ;-). In a nutshell, it
does exactly what you think it would, inserts a "top of page" link in your Wiki
page. The only option is a string that is inserted into the content of the markup.
This defaults to a single circumflex "!^" character (more commonly known as a caret),
surrounded by square brackets. The anchor element returned includes a "Top of Page"
title attribute so the user knows its purpose, and a "topofpage" class so the Wiki
author may style it in any way they please.

{{{
[[Top]] becomes:

[<a href="#" class="topofpage" title="Top of page">^</a>]
}}}

You could of course achieve the same effect by doing this:

{{{
{{{
#!html
[<a href="#" class="topofpage" title="Top of page">^</a>]
}}}
}}}

Resulting in this:

{{{
#!html
[<a href="#" class="topofpage" title="Top of page">^</a>]
}}}

But who wants to do all that typing? That's what [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science) macros]
are for after all. Note that the brackets do not form part of the anchor itself.
That is a personal preference. If you pass a string to the macro they are ommited.
